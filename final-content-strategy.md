## AI-Generated Images

### Monday - Theme: Funny Questions About Online Gaming. Post Type: Meme.
- **Image Description:** Create a humorous digital illustration of a gamer sitting in front of a computer screen with a surprised, exaggerated expression. The gamer is wearing a headset, and in the background, there is a whimsical scene where various characters like a cat, a family member, or a pet are trying to get their attention in funny ways. One could be waving a sign saying "Dinner's Ready!" while another is trying to vacuum around them. The computer screen shows a paused game with the text overlay: "When you're in the middle of a boss fight and your mom walks in...". Bright, vibrant colors and cartoonish styles should dominate the image.

### Wednesday - Theme: Gaming Quizzes. Post Type: Quiz.
- **Image Description:** Design a sleek, eye-catching graphic featuring a gaming controller surrounded by a variety of gaming icons like coins, hearts, and power-ups.
