    Based on the game information and topics given, develop a
    comprehensive content calendar for a week. The calendar should
    specify the theme for each day of the week (from Monday to Sunday)
    where some content should be posted, and preliminary ideas for
    post content. For now, focus on a three-day content calendar,
    including the most relevant keywords and hashtags to use in each
    post.
    The focus of the following week is the following:
    <NEXT_WEEK_CONTENT>{topic_of_the_week}</NEXT_WEEK_CONTENT>
  expected_output: >
    A detailed week-long content calendar, formatted as markdown, that includes days of the week (from monday to friday), a brief overview of content ideas, and the most relevant keywords and hashtags to use in each post. Ensure the calendar aligns with the identified trends and audience preferences.
